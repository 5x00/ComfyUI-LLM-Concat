# ComfyUI-Prompt-Plus
Prompt Plus is a collection of LLM and VLM nodes that make prompting easier for image and video generation.

⭐ Trigger Words to Prompt
⭐ Guided VLM Prompter

## Nodes
### Trigger2Prompt
Let's use combine any number of trigger words and combine them into a single prompt through a guided approach. This can be useful if you're running a VLM node or captioner on multiple images and need to combine the data into a prompt.
There are three variations to this node > [API] uses ChatGPT/Claude for processing, [Custom] uses Phi-3.5-mini for local processing, and [Simple] let's you parse the string as it is without an processing.
